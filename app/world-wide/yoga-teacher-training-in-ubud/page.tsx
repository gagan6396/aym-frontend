            At The Association For Yoga And Meditation, We Suggest Our Students
            Go Through The 300-Hour Yoga Books. This Is Because Reading These

            Yoga-Related Information, Including Its History, Benefits, Aspects
            And More. When You Complete Reading The Book And Join The Yoga
            Teacher Therapy Training Courses, It Will Become Easier For You To
            Understand Everything That Will Be Taught During The Class.
            Moreover, Reading Books On Yoga Before Joining The 300-Hour Yoga
            Teacher Training Course Will Also Improve Your Comprehension. The
            Books Suggested By Our Yogis Are The Autobiography Of A Yogi
            Paramahansa Yogananda And The Light On Yoga – By B.K.S Iyengar.
            These Two Books Are No Less Than A Wealth Of Older Literature That
