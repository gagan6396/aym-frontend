          <p className={styles.bodyText}>
            An ashram is a home which remains away from the hustle-bustle of
            city life. It is a place usually located amidst a calm and peaceful
            environment ranging from hills to forests to riverside. People visit
            ashram for the practice of spirituality, meditation and learning
            yoga. While living in an ashram, you must wake up early and do
            mantra chanting and yoga practice. You must also be part of ashram
            lifestyle and do some work as your Karma. An ashram is a spiritual
            school where you learn to live a disciplined life. At AYM yoga
            ashram you can read and learn all about yoga and meditation through
            classes taken by yoga masters, and also by books on yoga that are
            available in an ashram. The ashram is a home away from home where
            students can stay, read, study and practice yoga in a peaceful,
            undisturbed environment.

          </h2>
          <p className={styles.bodyText}>
            Yoga ashram is considered the best place to learn yoga because it is
            located away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and is free
            from interruptions and disturbances. AYM Yoga ashram has experienced
            and qualified teachers who teach different styles and aspects of
            yoga. Regular yoga practice with various asanas allows people to
            have a healthy mind and body free of toxins and harmful things. It
            is an ashram where people learn to focus and concentrate on doing
            one particular thing at a time or a set of skills while doing a
            specific kind of work.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.bodyText}>
            Once at our ashram, people can focus on themselves and find who they
            are and what they want to do. Also, at AYM Yoga Ashram, people find
            the true meaning of life and find out how they can serve themselves
            by serving others. Once they have become well-versed in one or more
            styles of yoga and have learned to meditate, they can get back to
            their lives and work better and more efficiently. By doing so, they
            are equipped with life skills to start progressing.
