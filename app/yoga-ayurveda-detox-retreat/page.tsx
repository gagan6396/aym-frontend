          We have a responsibility to take care of this body and mind. What do
          we do to take care of it? Ever thought of it? We buy a car don&apos;t
          we service it regularly so that it doesn&apos;t break down when we go
          on a trip. If we own a car for 10 years, how many times would we
          service our car? Maybe more than 15 times at least? What happens if we
          don&apos;t? Now how many times we serviced or did maintenance of our
          body? From the time we were born until now we could have eaten all
          kinds of food, that may include good healthy food or bad, unhealthy
          food, chemical preservative, junk food, fast food, etc.

          The toxin is any substance which hurts the body. The toxin can also
          look like the monster in the body, they are stranger substance in the
          body, and its presence is not needed for example heavy metals,
          artificial chemicals, a preservative that found in all the food items
          we eat from fruits to vegetable.

          It is said you are, what you eat, but more importantly, you are what
          you ate. That burger you ate one year ago would still be seating
          inside you. All the food like sugar, cheese, biscuits, namkeen, tea,
          coffee, chips all the things which don&apos;t come from mother nature
          becomes extremely difficult to digest and eliminate. It can stick to
          the walls of your intestines and forms a thick coating, most diseases
          like high cholesterol levels, diabetics, high blood pressure originate
          from here because of the accumulation of toxins in the body.

          inside your system. In other words, bath your internal system. Once
