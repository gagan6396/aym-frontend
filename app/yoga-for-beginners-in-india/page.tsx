              Yoga is more than just a series of poses; it&apos;s a holistic
              approach to health. It originated in ancient India and emphasizes
              the connection between the body, mind, and spirit. The practice
              usually includes:
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>Asanas (Postures):</strong> Physical positions that
              enhance flexibility, strength, and balance.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>Pranayama (Breath Control):</strong> Techniques that focus
              on breath awareness and control to promote relaxation and energy.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>Meditation:</strong> Practices aimed at calming the mind

              Benefits of Yoga for Beginners
            </h3>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>1. Increased Flexibility:</strong> Regular practice helps
              loosen tight muscles, improving overall flexibility and range of
              motion.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>2. Enhanced Strength:</strong> Many yoga poses require
              different muscle groups, helping build and tone muscles.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>3. Stress Relief:</strong> Yoga encourages relaxation and
              helps alleviate stress through mindfulness and deep breathing.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>4. Improved Focus:</strong> Mindfulness practices enhance
              concentration and mental clarity.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.bodyText}>
              <strong>5. Better Posture:</strong> Yoga promotes awareness of
              body alignment, which can lead to better posture and reduce the
              risk of injury.
