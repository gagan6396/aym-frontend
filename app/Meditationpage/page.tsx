        <h3 className={styles.sectionHeading}>What is Meditation?</h3>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Meditation cannot be explained in words. Words serve as signposts, pointing toward something, but they are not the thing itself. As a great one once said, "words are the fingers pointing towards the moon but they are not the moon itself." So, what are those signposts? Meditation can be many different things. It is that vast inner space within you, a constant and complete bliss and joy. It is the connection to something so much bigger, in which you are connected to every living being in the universe. It is the space where you are the complete watcher of everything. You do nothing but watch life unfold in front of you and sit in complete, absolute awareness. Emotions, sounds, pleasures, or senses do not linger; they simply come, stay for a while, and go. It is when you understand that the entire universe dwells within you. You realize your entire life is inside of you, merely touched by outside circumstances. You sit and receive the wisdom of the world, learning more than in your entire education, yet finding no words that can express that knowledge. When you open yourself completely and surrender to God or the divine, that moment of surrender is when you fully accept your life is happening before you. You become the watcher, and everything works through you and for you. Meditation is digging deep within and constantly finding surprises about yourself, the world, the universe, and love. It is a beautiful process of unfolding or peeling to reach that complete, blissful core essence. Once you begin this inner journey, all desires vanish, and you want nothing but to go deeper.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionHeading}>What is your favorite method of meditation?</h3>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Vipassana involves sitting in a comfortable meditative posture. Focus on your breathing and the fact that you are now sitting. As you breathe, repeat in your mind: "in, out, sitting" or "rising, falling, sitting." You can focus either on your nostrils or on your abdomen. Repeat this a few times and keep your focus with the breath. Note that each round is an individual round. Keep repeating until you feel comfortable. Usually, after a few rounds of noting, meditation comes. If you lose concentration at any point, return your awareness to the breath. During meditation, if any thought or emotion comes up, try to remain the watcher. Do not attach to any of them; just see them come, stay a while, and go.

      {/* ── Active Meditation ── */}
      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h3 className={styles.sectionHeading}>What is active meditation?</h3>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Active meditation uses the energy of the body to silence the mind. You use lots of energy before sitting still. This could involve exercises such as dancing or aerobatic movements. This type of meditation increases your blood circulation and heats up the body. Your mind's focus and energy shift fully onto the body instead of the brain or thoughts. Once the exercises are done, the meditator sits for a few minutes to absorb the changes in the body. Focus the energy on relaxing the muscles that have been working. This makes it easier for beginner meditators to focus and feel only positive feelings with minimal mind activity. This method is very new and not used traditionally. It is meant for the fast-paced life humans experience these days. It trains the mind to shift quickly from activity to calm. This method is usually used at the beginning of meditation. With practice, the meditator can move to traditional static meditation, where sitting still becomes easier.

      {/* ── Static Meditation ── */}
      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h3 className={styles.sectionHeading}>What is static meditation?</h3>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Static meditation is a practice in which the meditator sits still, focusing inward until reaching a meditative state. Over time, meditation can expand into every action throughout the day, including brushing teeth, walking, doing chores, practicing Yoga, working, and other aspects of daily life. In this context, meditation means being fully mindful and aware of actions, sensations, and thoughts, both internally and externally. Unlike practices with vigorous movement, static meditation emphasizes stillness and doing each activity at its natural pace with complete energy and attention. This sustained and mindful practice sometimes takes more or less time but always centers on careful awareness. Through static meditation, one aims to connect to the universe's powers, attain advanced meditative stages, and possibly remain in such a state for extended periods. Vipassana meditation, as referenced above, exemplifies a method that can lead to traditional static meditation.

This helps in focusing on oneself and getting free of distractions while meditating.
