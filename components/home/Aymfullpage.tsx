          <p className={styles.para}>
            I was thinking of addressing this significant topic with you. There are numerous Yoga schools,
            colleges, institutes, and ashrams worldwide that offer Yoga certifications, diplomas, and degrees;
            however, how many of them incorporate the art of alignment and adjustment into their course curriculum?
            In Rishikesh, there are very few, almost none, except at our school.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.para}>
            There are very few experts in the universe who are the complete masters of the alignment and
            adjustment of asana or postures. There are three planes of the body that yoga experts frequently use
            in teaching yoga postures and describing how the body moves during entry into asanas or while holding
            asanas. For example, when practicing the triangle pose, students often move to the wrong plane because
            they lack anatomical knowledge about the body's planes.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.para}>
            By knowing the different body planes correctly, you can use this knowledge in designing your yoga
            lesson planning to ensure you're moving and strengthening your body in all the correct directions.
            A proper understanding of the three different planes of the body helps you comprehend the body in
            various asanas, and it brings better flexibility as the body is stretched in the correct direction
            of movement.
